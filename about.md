My name is Jan Kalina (Honza, informally) and I am software developer at Red Hat. In this blog I would like to introduce some news and experiences from development of WildFly Elytron and from Java development in general.

Elytron is new security framework of WildFly - Java EE application server, which was known as JBoss Application Server earlier.
This blog will be aimed to some interesting points of individual parts of the framework.
If you would like to read more about purpose and design of WildFly Elytron in general, I can recommend you following links:
